# zish - A zsh theme inspired by fish

## Installation
If you only want the theme and already have `oh-my-zsh` installed, simply download the `zish.zsh-theme` file into `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/` and set `ZSH_THEME` to `zish` in your `.zshrc` file.

However, you can also use the install script, which automatically installs `oh-my-zsh`, the required plugins and the theme, **and** also sets custom syntax highlighting colors in the `.zshrc` file.
For that you can simply execute
```
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RubixDev/HandyLinuxStuff/main/zish/install.sh | bash
```
or
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RubixDev/HandyLinuxStuff/main/zish/install.sh | bash
```
