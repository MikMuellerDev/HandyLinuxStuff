# zish - A zsh theme inspired by fish

## Installation
If you only want the theme and already have `oh-my-zsh` installed, simply download the `zish.zsh-theme` file into `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/` and set `ZSH_THEME` to `zish` in your `.zshrc` file.

Alternatively you can use the install script, which automatically installs `oh-my-zsh` and the required plugins, and applies the theme all on its own.
For that you can simply execute `sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RubixDev/random-linux-stuff/main/zish/install.sh)"`
